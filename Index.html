					What's New!
				</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The iSight Wearable AI eyeglasses made by Grayscale Business is an important innovation. Its benefits alone could be the deciding factor whether customers will want to buy it because it now becomes a need where every person who's visually challenged should have this type of eyeglasses as it will open so many o pportunities for them to see life once more virtually.

					Non-Commodity Software
				</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The software we added to our iSight is intricately customized for
					the needs of a PWD person. It was built-in and was exactly made for
					the purpose of giving them the help they need and the aid they
					deserved. It comes with different technologies that are unique to them
					in order to be effective with handling different situations that are not
					common and normal for non-disabled people.
